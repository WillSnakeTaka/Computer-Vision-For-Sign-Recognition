# 🌟 Signalyze: Sign Language to Text-to-Speech

Bridging communication gaps with **AI-driven Sign Language Recognition**! 🚀

---

## 📖 Overview

Signalyze is a cutting-edge application that recognizes sign language gestures in real-time and converts them into **text** and **speech**, enhancing communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.

### 🧩 Key Features:
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Capture and classify hand gestures instantly.
- **Text and Speech Output**: Convert recognized gestures into human-readable text and synthesized speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive app for seamless interaction.

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Use datasets like Sign Language MNIST (via Kaggle).
   - Normalize and augment data for enhanced model performance.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for gesture classification.
   - Evaluate and fine-tune the model for real-world performance.

3. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Implement video streaming via OpenCV.
   - Use MediaPipe for efficient hand tracking and gesture recognition.

4. **Text-to-Speech Integration**:
   - Map classified gestures to corresponding text.
   - Convert text into speech using gTTS or Pyttsx3.

5. **App Deployment**:
   - Build a user-friendly interface using Flask.
   - Enable real-time classification and output.
